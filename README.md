# LeetCode

Solutions for LeetCode challenges.

## What

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) is a website that offers a collection of programming problems that often appear in recruitment tests for tech giants. Along with the huge collection of problems, they host weekly and biweekly competitive programming contests, and since April they host month-long challenges during which a new problem is made available each day. Completing every problem for the month before the next problem is posted makes one eligible for a prize raffle.

This is the repository for my solutions for these daily problems.


## Why

I don't really care for the prize part or the competitive aspect, but I find these daily challenge to be nice prompts to do a bit of coding every day, which is a routine I've tried to stick to for several months now. They range in difficulty and span over several subjects in algorithms and data structures, so they are also a quite nice learning opportunity. Because of that I think it may be useful to make my solutions available online in a clear enough format and with enough code documentation so others can learn from them.


## How

To avoid spoiling the fun I won't post any solution to a problem before the next problem is published. This also means you can't copy-paste my solutions to cheat the challenge, as by the time they are available they won't score any point anymore.

I usually do them in Python because that's the language I have the most fun with, but given enough free time I may also port all of them to JavaScript and/or PHP. I try to stick to common idioms for each language but if you see something that may be written in a better way feel free to get in touch or submit a patch.

Each solution file is self-contained as an executable script that can be run from the shell in a Linux environment. It may work on other platforms but that's not tested (yet). I use test-driven development as my coding process, so for each problem I first write a couple test cases from the examples given on the problem page and leave them in the file when I'm done.

Enjoy!
