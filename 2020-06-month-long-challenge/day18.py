# Day 18: H-Index II
#
# Given an array of citations sorted in ascending order (each citation is a
# non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the
# researcher's h-index.
# According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h
# if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h
# papers have no more than h citations each."
#
# Notes:
# - If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the
#   h-index.
# - Expected runtime complexity is in O(log n) and the input is sorted.
